#           Will have to create a list of recipes that follow the same format
#           Each recipe will first have to check if the player has the correct materials in their stockpile

#           If the Item is crafted successfully then the items used to create the object and the new object is
#           added to the stockpile
#           In order to craft more advanced item you will need to make a crafting bench, this allows for stable and
#           better created items.
#           Without the crafting table the chance for a recipe to be created successfully drops significantly.
